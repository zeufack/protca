A simple protractor framework to run e2e test using typescript a cucumber 
to start, assume you have nodejs and protractro globaly then
clone this repository to your local machine with:

then assume you have webdriver-manager (come with protractor installation) runngin with 

```bash
    webdriver-manager update && webdriver-manager start
```

Start by installing all dependencies by running

```bash
    npm install

Then compiling the typescript source in the project with

```bash
    npm run build
```

this command will create a build folder in your project with plain javascipt code 

run test with

```bash
    npm run test
```

you can add new test by creating a .feature in features folder with steps inside steps folder.
